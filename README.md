## Introduction
The time has come: Verve goes into the next round and better, more extensive and more realistic than before! Experience Minecraft 1.16 like never before! Verve invites you to spend hour after hour immersed in the game and simply marvel at the world. It never gets boring. You'll always have something to do. The world is yours!

Verve 2 now includes magic, but without breaking with the atmosphere of Minecraft. All magic is drawn from nature. Nothing just comes from anywhere. After all, we're playing Minecraft, not reading a Marvel comic. Lose yourself in the vastness of the universe with Astral Sorcery, control the powers of nature in Botania, or use essences and become the most powerful alchemist in the land using Theurgy!

Of course, classics are also included, which are the foundation of Verve. TerraForged will introduce you to fascinating worlds like you've never seen before, every time. With the additional configuration options, nothing stands in your way of designing your worlds right at the generation. Create now offers you all the more mechanics: Build entire trains to travel across the countryside while hauling your production goods in a wagon behind you to produce the latest technologies from Mekanism or Immersive Engineering or food from Pam's Harvestcraft in your own large-scale factory.

But much has happened in the universe: Dimensions have reshaped themselves, new beings enter the stage of life and the world is full of ancient dangers. Loot the dungeons of past civilizations, explore the far reaches of the End, and climb mysterious towers scattered throughout the world!

**The world is at your mercy and Verve gives you the tools to mould it to your will.**
